#### In general:
- Use buttons when the user- action causes a change in either back-end or the front-end of the website. For example, submitting a form, opening a pop-up or a modal or a panel on the same page.  
  
- Use links when the user-action doesnâ€™t affect the website at all. In this, the users are just readers or spectators of the site. For example, to navigate to the next page or an external source after viewing the content of the page.  
  
- Is the intention to send someone to another URL? Use a link  
- Is it to trigger some on-page interactivity? Use a button.  
Any deviation from those and you better know what you're effing doing.  
  
you can design a link as a button as long as the function is still a link

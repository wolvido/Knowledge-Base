#html 
keywords:
	html section

Section is NOT generic, it is used to section related **content**. Any related content, anything that provides info is content.

You do not use section for a toolbar because a toolbar is functionality, not content, you can however include a toolbar in a section if it is part of related content. Use div for toolbars.

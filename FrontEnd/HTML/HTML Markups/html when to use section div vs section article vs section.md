A section is a group of elements with meaning but cant stand alone.  
Div is meaningless, it groups elements not semantically related. Mostly used for grouping css class styles.  
  
If inside a section there are elements that can stand alone its probably an article, if not a content its a div. 
  
Section can stand alone in a sense when grouped with other sections, like chapters in a book.  
  
section vs article  
  
An article represents content that can be taken out of the document and away from the immediate surrounding content, dropped somewhere else, say on another page, and still make total sense as it is grouped.  
  
In the same way that you could use an article, such as a table lamp (an independent content group), to improve the aesthetics of your living room, and it would complement your sofa, tv console, curtains, and so on (immediate surrounding content). Yet, if you were to take your table lamp into your room, and it was simply placed at your bedside or your workstation, it would still be identifiable as a complete lamp.  
  
The section element, on the other hand, represents “a thematic grouping of content,” meaning that a section is a part of a larger group without which it may not necessarily stand to make complete sense alone. It may stand alone, but in the theme of your content overall, it is less likely to be standalone. As the spec put it, “Examples of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A website’s home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, and contact information.”

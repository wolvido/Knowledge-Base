Not recommended by yandex, but also according to them there is no strict method.

For general how to position blocks see [[how to position blocks]].

in special circumstances where wrapper is necessary for style like flex or grids, yandex recommends in order:  
1. treat is as a usable block and finding the suitable semantic name.  
2. Think of the elements as a a layout. name the elements as the layout of the block e.g. block__section or block__subsection.  
3. name-wrapper can be used in small cases, once or twice.

In general, find a way to name it.

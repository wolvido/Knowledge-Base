Seq is a real-time search and analysis server for structured application logs and traces.
Helps you to monitor and analyse the logs in real time.
# How-To:
#### Installation
- go to https://datalust.co/seq download and install.
- nuget install **Serilog.Sinks.Seq**.
#### Initiate Seq
- click browse seq, it will automatically take the localhost http://localhost:5341.
- on the upper right click tail, it looks like infinity with a play, It makes it ready to receive the logs.
**Currently it will not produce logs, it is not connected to your app yet. To connect it, it needs to be configured.**
#### Configuration
```json
"Serilog": {
	"Using": [
		"Serilog.Sinks.Seq"
	],
	"MinimumLevel": "LogLevel", //dont forget to change this
	"WriteTo": [
		{
			"Name": "Seq",
			"Args": {
				"serverUrl": "http://localhost:5341"
					//serverUrl is where the program will send the log and where seq should be listening.
					//localhost:5341 is the default local of seq, change it as necessary.
			}
		}
	]
}
```
###### Go back to seq, you will notice the log will be posted, if not make sure the tail button is orange.
#### Request ID
It is worth noting that every http request log will have a request ID generated by asp.net, it is also called the trace identifier.

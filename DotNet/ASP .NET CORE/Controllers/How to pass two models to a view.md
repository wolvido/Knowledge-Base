You dont, thats impossible and would be a bad practice.
Instead arrange the data that the view needs before you pass.
More likely you want to pass a specific part of a list of models.
Use LINQ instead to pass only one item of the list of models.
heres a sample:
```c#
﻿using WeatherSolution.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace WeatherSolution.Controllers
{
 public class WeatherController : Controller
 {
  //initialize hard-coded data as instructed in the requirement
  private List<CityWeather> cities = new List<CityWeather>() {
    new CityWeather() { CityUniqueCode = "LDN", CityName = "London", DateAndTime = Convert.ToDateTime("2030-01-01 8:00"), TemperatureFahrenheit = 33 },

    new CityWeather() { CityUniqueCode = "NYC", CityName = "New York", DateAndTime = Convert.ToDateTime("2030-01-01 3:00"), TemperatureFahrenheit = 60 },

    new CityWeather() { CityUniqueCode = "PAR", CityName = "Paris", DateAndTime = Convert.ToDateTime("2030-01-01 9:00"), TemperatureFahrenheit = 82 }
   };


  //When a HTTP GET request is received at path "/"
  [Route("/")]
  public IActionResult Index()
  {
   //send cities collection to "Views/Weather/Index" view
   return View(cities);
  }


  [Route("weather/{cityCode?}")]
  public IActionResult City(string? cityCode)
  {
   //if cityCode is not supplied in the route parameter
   if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(cityCode))
   {
    //send null as model object to "Views/Weather/Index" view
    return View();
   }

   //Use LINQ to get matching city object based on the city code
   CityWeather? city = cities.Where(temp => temp.CityUniqueCode == cityCode).FirstOrDefault();

   //send matching city object to "Views/Weather/Index" view
   return View(city);
  }
 }
}
```

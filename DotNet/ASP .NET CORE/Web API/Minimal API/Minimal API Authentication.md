To implement authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core Minimal API, you can leverage the authentication and authorization middleware provided by the framework. Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:
- Install the required NuGet packages for the authentication and authorization middleware. For example, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.
- Configure the desired authentication scheme(s) in the services collection. This typically involves setting up authentication options, such as JwtBearer or cookies, and specifying the authentication provider details.
- Use the UseAuthentication and UseAuthorization middleware in the request pipeline. Ensure that the UseAuthentication middleware is placed before the routing middleware to authenticate incoming requests.
- Apply the necessary authorization attributes to the API endpoints or handler functions to restrict access. For example, [Authorize] attribute can be used to specify that only authenticated users are allowed to access an endpoint.
###### Here's an example of configuring JWT authentication and applying authorization to an endpoint:
```c#
// Services
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
.AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
  // Configure JWT authentication options
});

builder.Services.AddAuthorization();

// Request pipeline
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapMethods("/api/protected", new[] { "GET" }, () =>
{
  // This endpoint requires authorization
}).RequireAuthorization();

app.Run();
```

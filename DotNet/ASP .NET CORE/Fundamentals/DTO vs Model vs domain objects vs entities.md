Harsha that dumb bitch, for him models and entities and domain models are all fucking the same. Except for DTO. Jesus christ. Or maybe he is right, gpt also calls domain models as entities.
will have to wait for him to clear his nonsense in the clean architecture section.

My understanding is they are all essentially the same, the general term for all of them is Domain models/Entities. 
- The difference is in where their "domain" is. So a view model is also a domain model, but its domain is in the view. 
- A DTO is essentially still the same, but its domain is in the service.
- Domain model is the general term for all of them.
- Entity is synonymous to domain model.


In terms of usage, like this [[Model]] they are basically the same, but the difference is where they are used, DTO is used in the service layer, view model is used in the views etc..  see this: [Difference between DTO, Model and Entity | DTO vs Model | DTO vs Model vs Entity | csharp | Dotnet - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKowHmVWqAc)

 see:[[N-tier architecture]].

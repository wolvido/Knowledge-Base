#cSharp 
Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface. An interface morphs into many usable forms in classes depending on what you need, a base class has derive classes that morph into specialized forms depending on your specialized needs.
see [[Polymorphism]].

It is achieved by using [[Inheritance]], [[Method Overriding]], [[Abstract class]], [[Interface]], [[Knowledge Base/DotNet/cSharp/cSharp Keywords and Additional Material/generic|generic]]

There are several reasons why they decided strings are made immutable:  
  
Efficiency: Immutable objects are more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance. Since strings are widely used and can be quite large, making them immutable allows for optimizations in memory allocation and storage. It also enables string sharing, where multiple references to the same string can be safely used without worrying about unintended modifications.  
  
Thread safety: In multi-threaded environments, immutability provides inherent thread safety. Since strings cannot be modified, multiple threads can safely access and use the same string object without conflicts or the need for explicit synchronization.  
  
Ease of caching and hashability: Immutable objects can be easily cached and reused, which can improve performance in certain scenarios. Additionally, immutability allows strings to be used as keys in hash tables or dictionaries since their hash code remains constant.  
  
Predictability and reliability: Immutable objects simplify programming by ensuring that once a string is created, it remains unchanged. This predictability makes it easier to reason about code behavior and prevents accidental modifications, leading to more reliable and bug-free code.  
  
There are also disadvantages:  
They can be less efficient when many modifications are made to a string, as a new string must be created for each modification.  
  
They can use more memory, as multiple strings may need to be stored if many modifications are made to a single string.  
  
Essentially its a language design, they figured that an immutable string has more advantage than disadvantage.  
  
## is string a reference type or a value type  
String is also a class, which means its a reference type, but they designed it to be immutable due to reasons mentioned above. it is a reference type but acts like a value type.

[C# Keywords | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/)
note: not to be confused with keywords in this vault's notes, those act as tags for searching since obsidian tags don't allow space.

Keywords are predefined, reserved [[identifiers]] that have special meanings to the compiler. They can't be used as [[identifiers]] in your program unless they include `@` as a prefix. For example, `@if` is a valid [[identifier]], but `if` isn't because `if` is a keyword. Contextual keywords have special meaning only in a limited program context and can be used as [[identifiers]] outside that context.
see: [[Identifiers]]  for more details on what an identifier is.

reserved keywords: old, cannot be used as [[identifiers]].
contextual keywords: new, can be used as [[identifiers]], and has multiple uses in different context. for more info see [[contextual keywords]]

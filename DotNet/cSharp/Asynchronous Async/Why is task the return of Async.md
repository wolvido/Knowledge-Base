this will explain why task is the return and also the task with generic

Task is an old thing in C#
it was originally used for asynchronous stuff and was used like this
```c#
public void DoWork()
{
public int SomeAsyncMethod()
{
    // Asynchronous work here
    return 42;
}

    Task<int> task = Task.Run(() => SomeAsyncMethod());

    task.ContinueWith(completedTask =>
    {
        if (completedTask.Status == TaskStatus.RanToCompletion)
        {
            int result = completedTask.Result;
            // Process the result
        }
        else if (completedTask.Status == TaskStatus.Faulted)
        {
            Exception exception = completedTask.Exception;
            // Handle the exception
        }
    });
}


```
In the above example, we create a `Task<int>` using `Task.Run()`, and then we use `task.ContinueWith()` to define what happens when the task completes. This approach required more manual handling of tasks and their results compared to the later introduction of `await` and `async`, which made asynchronous code more readable and less error-prone.

Task is a class, that was designed to represent an asynchronous operation or a unit of work that can be executed asynchronously. A lambda or a delegate that is passed into task will run asynchronously, meaning it will be blocked until the thread is finished.

The `Task` class provides methods and properties for creating, starting, and managing asynchronous operations. It also supports features like continuation, cancellation, error handling, and progress reporting, which make it a versatile tool for handling various aspects of asynchronous programming and parallelism in C#, see the example above.

but task was hard to use, so they made a syntactic sugar called Async, see [[Asynchronous Async]].

So the reason why Task is the return of Async is because task is awaitable, it has the asynchronous mechanisms, it performs a method that "awaits" when used by a caller, that returned awaitable that has awaiting methods is a **Task**.
sample:
```c#
public void SampleMethod()
{
	AnAsyncMethod();
}
```
that Async method will return a Task which the caller can run and has asynchronous mechanisms that has already been set by the Async method.

**What about the task that has a generic: ``Task<int> or Task<anyType>``?**
When a `Task` has a generic type parameter, such as `Task<T>`, it means that the `Task` represents an asynchronous operation that will produce a result of type `T` when it completes. In other words, the `Task<T>` type is used when you expect your asynchronous operation to return a value, and you want to capture that value once the operation finishes.
sample:
```c#
async Task<int> CalculateAsync() // set Task<int> as return
{
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second asynchronously
    return 42; // the int to be returned once await is done
}

// Usage:
var resultTask = CalculateAsync();
int result = await resultTask; // Asynchronously wait for the result, result will return 42 and run the await

Console.WriteLine(result);
```
result will hold 42 and run the awaiting method it hold, if you use ``Task<int>`` to hold result like:
```c#
Task<int> result = await resultTask;
```
The methods will still run but it will not hold 42, it will hold the task object. As mentioned before task is a class, that was designed to represent an asynchronous operation or a unit of work that can be executed asynchronously. 

Let's clarify the behavior:

1. **Using `var`:**
```c#
var resultTask = CalculateAsync();
```
In this case, the `var` keyword allows the compiler to infer the correct type based on the result of ``await CalculateAsync();`` It implicitly returns an int variable and assigns the result of the awaited task to it. The awaited method in ``CalculateAsync(); ``executes as expected.
2. **Using `Task<Int>`:**
```c#
Task<Int> resultTask = await CalculateAsync();
```
Here, you explicitly specify that `resultTask` is of type `Task<int>`. The awaited method in `CalculateAsync()` still executes as expected, and the return of the awaited task is stored in `resultTask`. However, if you want to access the actual `int` type, you would need to use `resultTask.Result` after the `await`.

In both cases, the awaited method within `CalculateAsync()` is executed asynchronously, and the code waits for its completion before proceeding. The only difference is in how you declare and work with the variable that holds the `Task<User>` representing the asynchronous operation's result.

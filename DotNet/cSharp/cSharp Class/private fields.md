Why? Because encapsulation. Imagine having a car with hundreds of buttons that control every little thing in which there's a button that allows you to shut down power, where there's also a button that sparks the spark plug. That is all unnecessary and dangerous, shutting down power should only happen when the car is parked and the engine off, sparking the spark plug should only happen when the car is being turned on. That is what encapsulation is, that is why fields need to be private because we don't need to disconnect the power of the car ourselves, it only needs to be disconnected when parked and engine off. That's why we have constructors, when we want to use the car everything is constructed we don't need to manually spark the plug. I don't really know much about cars, but you get my point.

A byte is a unit of measurement of information. It is made up of 8 bits. A bit is the smallest possible unit of information, it's just a yes/no answer to a questions. A byte, being a collection of 8 bits, stores 8 yes/no answers. It's a bit more complicated than this and there is some math involved, but it is simply to think of a byte as a unit that can encode any of the letters of the alphabet, lower and upper case, plus numbers, punctuation and special signs like %$#.

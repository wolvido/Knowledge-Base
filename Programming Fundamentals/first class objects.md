The ability of a programming language to treat functions or methods in the same way as other data types, such as integers, strings, or objects.

Objects that can do anything be used in anything. Can be dynamically created, destroyed, passed to a function, returned as a value, and have all the rights as other variables in the programming language have. 
  
why first-class? because like first class citizens, they can do anything.

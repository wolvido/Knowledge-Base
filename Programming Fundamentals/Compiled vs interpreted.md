compiled:
In a compiled language, code is first translated into machine code or an intermediate representation by a compiler before it is executed. The compilation process typically occurs before the program is run, and the resulting binary or bytecode file is then executed.  see [[What is CLR, JIT, IL]]

interpreted:
In an interpreted language, code is executed directly by an interpreter, line by line, as the program runs. The interpreter reads the source code, translates it into machine code or bytecode (which can be platform-specific or platform-independent, respectively), and executes it immediately. 

Why use interpreted when a JIT is efficient and can run everywhere? this was before JIT maybe. Java was made after or just same time as ruby.

Remember, always find a way to encapsulate. If complex algorithms exist that can be considered its own class or maybe a subclass, then do it, encapsulate it. 
Classes should only contain its own algorithms its own personality so to say, a class should not be the whole program.
Basically try to break down everything. Polymorph if you have to. see. [[Polymorphism]]
if you still somehow forget, see: [mosh, c# intermediate, section 5, method overriding](https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop/learn/lecture/2243584#overview)

**_"Software entities (such as classes, modules, and functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification."_** 
-Bertrand Meyer

In simpler terms, this principle encourages you to design your software in a way that allows you to add new functionality or extend existing functionality on classes, modules, or functions, without modifying the existing. see [[Interface Extensibility and Polymorphism]] to see it in action. OCP can also be implemented with [[Inheritance]] but Interface is much more preffered.

Essentially, make sure your design is extensible.

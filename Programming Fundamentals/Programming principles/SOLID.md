[[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)]]
[[Open-Closed Principle (OCP)]]
[[Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)]]
[[Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)]]
[[Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)]]

REMEMBER: These are guidelines, there are times when it will not better to use a solid principle, except for liskov, liskov principle should be followed no matter what. Liskov is a genius.
1. **Context Matters**: The applicability of the SOLID principles can vary depending on the size and complexity of your project. For a small, simple project, adhering to every principle rigorously may be overkill. On the other hand, for a large, complex project with many developers, adhering to these principles can greatly improve code maintainability.
2. **Trade-offs**: Sometimes, following one principle might require making trade-offs with another. For example, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle might result in more classes and smaller methods, which can be beneficial for maintainability but may increase complexity in the short term.
3. **Practicality**: While the SOLID principles offer valuable guidance, it's essential to balance them with practicality. There may be cases where strict adherence to a principle doesn't make sense, and pragmatic decisions should be made.
4. **Project Goals**: Consider the specific goals of your project. If rapid development is the primary objective, you might prioritize getting a working solution quickly over strict adherence to all SOLID principles. However, if long-term maintainability and scalability are essential, the principles become more relevant.

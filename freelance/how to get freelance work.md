### How to Get Freelance Clients
I encourage new developers to try and get some freelance clients before they start their job search. There are three good reasons for this:
1. It's much easier to get a freelance client than it is to get a full time job.
2. Freelance work is less risky since you can do it without quitting your day job.
3. You can start getting paid to code sooner, and start building your portfolio of professional work sooner.

Getting freelance clients can be much easier than getting a developer job. Why is this?

Think about small local businesses. It may just be a family that runs a restaurant. Or a shop. Or a plumbing company. Or a law firm.

How many of those businesses could benefit from having an interactive website, back office management systems, and tools to automate their common workflows? Most of them.

Now how many of those companies can afford to have a full-time software developer to build and maintain those systems? Not as many.

That's where freelancers come in. They can do work in a more economical, case-by-case basis. A small business can bring on a freelancer for a single project, or for a shorter period of time.

If you are actively building your network, some of the people you meet may become your clients.

For example, you may meet a local accountant who wants to update their website. And maybe add the ability to schedule a consultation, or accept a credit card payment for a bill. These are common features that small businesses may request, and you may get pretty good at implementing them.

You may also meet the managers of small businesses who need an ERP system, or a CRM system, or an inventory system, or one of countless other tools.

In many cases, there is an open source tool that you can deploy and configure for them. Then you can just teach them how to use that system. And you can bill them a monthly service fee to have you "on call" and ready to fix problems that may arise.

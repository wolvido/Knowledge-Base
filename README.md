# Knowledge Base Repository ðŸ“š
This repository is my personal coding reference library, where I document everything I've learned throughout my software development journey.  
It's designed first and foremost for my own consumption, tailored to my learning style and development journey.  
This repository isnâ€™t just a collection of notesâ€”itâ€™s an evolving archive that reflects my growth as a developer and serves as an indispensable tool in my coding toolkit.  
Primarily managed using Obsidian.  
## Whatâ€™s Inside:
- Code snippets for efficient implementation.
- Explanations of key concepts in .NET, Angular, JS, CSS, HTML and more.
- Troubleshooting guides, tips, and tricks based on real-world experience.
- Curated links to resources and tutorials for deeper exploration.
## Features:
- Continuously updated as I learn new technologies and refine existing knowledge.
- Structured for quick access through Obsidian, leveraging its powerful organization and search features.
- Highly personal: Content is written in a way that best suits my own understanding and workflow.
## Note:
This repository reflects my **learning journey**, not my current skill level. Some notes were written when I was still developing foundational skills and may not represent best practices or advanced knowledge. It's an evolving archive that captures where I started, where I am now, and where I'm headed.
